# HW1 Assignment: Basic-Portfolio
------------------------------------------------
 * Build a professional portfolio site using HTML/CSS.  
 
 ### Instructions
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Create a repository in GitHub called Basic-Portfolio.
 2. Create 3 HTML documents: index.html, contact.html, porfolio.html
 3. Create a folder called assets.  
   1. Make two additional folders: css and images
    - In the css folder, make a file called style.css
    - In the css folder, make a file called reset.css & include the Meyerweb reset
    - In the images folder, save the images you plan on using
    
### Styling
--------------------------------------------
#### Colors 
*Pro-tip: Use the Eye Dropper Chrome extension to find the colors used on web pages.

Teal color (used for headings and backgrounds): #4aaaa5
Regular font color (used for paragraphs and all text besides the headings): #777777
Main header background color: #ffffff
Main header border color: #cccccc
Footer background color: #666666
Main content background color: #ffffff
Main content border color: #dddddd

#### Fonts:
---------------------------------------------------------------
For heading fonts use font-family: 'Georgia', Times, Times New Roman, serif;.
For all other fonts use 'Arial', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;.

#### Social Link Images (Github, LinkedIn,  StackOverflow, etc.):
----------------------------------------------------------------------
These images can be found on IconFinder.
Ensure that these icons are live links to your GitHub, LinkedIn, and Stack Overflow profiles.

#### Background Images:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The background pattern used was found on Subtle Patterns. You can browse through that site and find whichever pattern you like.

#### Dimensions:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The entire content area is 960px wide.
The main section content is 650px wide.
The sidebar is 270px wide.
Pro-tip: Use the Page Ruler extension to measure the size of elements.

#### Bonus
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Make your pages more sophisticated by adding style to text links, to image links, and to buttons for when a user hovers their cursor over them. 
- You can use Adobe Kuler to find colors that match the theme (in this case, the primary color is Teal #4aaaa5).
- Make a "sticky footer." You will notice the dark grey footer will always rest just below the content. This is fine whenever your site has enough content to push it down past the height of most monitors. But if there isn't much content in the body, the footer could rest in the middle of the page:
